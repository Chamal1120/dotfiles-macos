## Prerequisites
I don't have a script to automate the nessaasy package installations at the moment. (it's WIP).

Till then, you need to manually install packages to your system.

### for Mac users

1. Install xcode command line tools

```bash
xcode-select --install
```
2. install homebrew
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

3. Install the nessary packages you need for your rice

```bash
# This will install all the packages I have used for the rice
brew install git wget gcc fd fzf ripgrep eza neovim tmux starship zsh-fast-syntax-highlighting yazi yt-dlp stow bat btop zoxide fastfetch koekeishiya/formulae/skhd koekeishiya/formulae/yabai && brew install --cask kitty wezterm firefox alt-tab anaconda
```

### for Linux users

** Just use your built in package manager and install the packages you need üòâ

## How to use
I manage my dotfiles with GNU `stow`. follow the below steps to simlink the files to necessary locations.

1. Install stow using homebrew or with any package manager. (or build from source).

```bash
brew install stow # if using homebrew (macOS/linux)
```

2. clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chamal1120/mac_rice.git
```
3. Navigate to the directory

```bash
cd mac_rice
```

4. Simlink the configs you need with `stow`.

```bash
stow bat btop fsh kitty nvim starship tmux yazi yt-dlp zsh hushlogin # This command will symlink all the configs
```
